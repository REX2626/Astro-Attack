# Astro-Attack


## TODO:
Improve asteroid image, add several asteroid images

Add AI states:
    Protrol state
    Attack state
    Retreat state

Enemy Grouping

Have different shoot speed for enemy and player

Add ship colliding with asteroids

Add animation framework

Make all artwork the same scale

### POTENTIAL

Add money system, different currencies, get cash from killing

Add shop system

Add loot system

Add fuel system


## DONE:
Make Enemy ships move around

Fix angle, so it is between +180 and -180

CHUNKS is globalled in objects.py

When updating entities, don't update every entity's chunk 
In entity.update(), if the entity moved, put entity into it's new chunk

Add asteroid class

Add rotation acceleration, so red_ship doesn't immediately stop rotating

Make turning more snappy

Adjust ship accleration (so faster if forward, slower if side to side)

Make bullet fire from the front of the ship

Add Images file

Make ship more detailed, have cross in the centre
Make ship smaller

Add a constants file (maybe class), so that any file can use any constant (without any circular import shenanigans)

Add player health

Add enemy ship class

Make Enemy only shoot when close to red_ship

Add stars in background, layered, which move

Dampen intertia before moving, so that acceleration is dampened 1 tick later, not straight away

Improve star drawing code, so stars aren't brute force placed around the side

Improve bullet shooting, so that the position the bullet is spawned at is relative to the size of the ship

Add score counter

Stop spawning anything in starting chunks

Add zoom

Don't blit objects which will not be on the screen

Limit the zooming in and out based on the chunk distance
